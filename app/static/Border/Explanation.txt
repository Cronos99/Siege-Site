OPERATORS:

BREACHERS
  -Thermite ( and Hibana). Need for opening large walls if reinforced. Hibana will be needed     some times, depending on defence so is good to have. 
  -Buck. Needed for opening hatches or softwalls quickly. In some rare situations claymore could be useful 

FLEX
  -Capitao(mabye Zofia). Help get the plant down and then protect it afterwards.

FRAGGER
  -Any. Doesn't really matter, having smokes could help but all down to their preference really
